This means that we will be analyzing data $d$ from one or more detectors, which is sampled at some constant sample rate $1/\\Delta t$ for a period of time $T$, yielding $N = T/\\Delta t$ samples (more on how to load data below).\n",

    "## The sampler\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are using the `emcee_pt` sampler. This is a parallel tempered sampler, so it requires a number of temperatures to be set. Note a few other differences from the analytic example here:\n",
    "  * The `burn-in-test` is set to `nacl & max_posterior`.\n",
    "  * Instead of an `niterations` option, we have `effective-nsamples = 1000`.\n",
    "  * A checkpoint interval is set: `checkpoint-interval = 2000`\n",
    "  * There is a `max-samples-per-chain` option.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are all options specific to MCMC samplers like `emcee_pt`. Details:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The burn in option\n",
    "Multiple burn in tests may be combined using standard boolean operators like `&` and `|`. In this example, we will consider the sampler to be burned in when it has passed the `nacl` test *and* the `max_posterior` test. This means:\n",
    "\n",
    " * `nacl`: The second half of the chain must be longer than 5 times the ACL. If so, the samlper is considered burned-in at the halfway point.\n",
    " * `max_posterior`: All of the walkers must find a point that has a log posterior greater than `maxP - ndim/2`, where `maxP` is the maximum posterior value found over all the walkers and `ndim` is the number of variable parameters. The first iteration for which all the walkers pass this test is the burn in iteration.\n",
    " \n",
    "By doing `&`, we take the larger iteration of these two tests. This combination of tests has worked well for `emcee_pt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Checkpointing\n",
    "When a `checkpoint-interval` is set, `pycbc_inference` will dump the results to a checkpoint file after every `checkpoint-interval` iterations. The checkpoint file has the same name as the output, but with `.checkpoint` added on to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "While ``pycbc_inference`` is running it will create a checkpoint file which\n",
    "is named ``{output-file}.checkpoint``, where ``{output-file}`` was the name\n",
    "of the file you specified with the ``--output-file`` command. If a `checkpoint-interval` is set, `pycbc_inference` will checkpoint after the given number of iterations. For `emcee_pt`, this means that it will dump the current samples to this file; when finished, the file is\n",
    "renamed to ``{output-file}``.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ``{output-file}.bkup`` is also created, which is a copy of the checkpoint file. This is kept in case the checkpoint file gets corrupted during writing. The ``.bkup`` file is deleted at the end of the run, unless ``--save-backup`` is turned on.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `pycbc_inference` is terminated while running (either by error, or by a system interrupt), the checkpoint and bkup files remain. When `pycbc_inference` is restarted, it will check for those files. If they are found, it will resume from where it last left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Termination condition\n",
    "By setting `effective-nsamples` we tell the `pycbc_inference` until it has an effective number of samples greater than or equal to the specified value. Effective samples are the number of independent samples of the posterior we have. This is given by number of samples that remain after burn-in and thinned by the autocorelation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of effective samples are counted at each checkpoint. For this reason, a checkpoint-interval must be provided if `effective-nsamples` is set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Max samples per chain\n",
    "If `max-samples-per-chain` is provided, `pycbc_inference` will ensure that no more than the given number of samples per chain are stored in the output file. Samples will be thinned on disk and in memory when a checkpoint happens to ensure this. This is important for keeping file size down. Without it, a GW run with `1000` walkers and `4` temps can result in a file that is over 100GB, since every sample will be saved. With `max-samples-per-chain = 1000`, the maximum file size is capped to ~1GB."
